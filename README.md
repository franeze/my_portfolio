### Strategic Insights for a Fictional Bike Share Company: The Cyclistic Bike-Share Project BI

<details> <summary>Scenario (click here)</summary>  
In this fictional scenario, I’ve joined the business intelligence team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in New York City. My role involves applying BI principles to analyze and enhance Cyclistic’s bike usage. I handled the data cleaning and processing through ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) using SQL, ensuring the datasets on bike trips and customer demographics are accurate and ready for analysis. I created a dashboard to provide insights into bike demand, considering factors like customer type, peak usage times, and weather conditions.

#### 1 - Project Documents 
<details> <summary> Documents details (click here) </summary>
The Project requirements document describes the overall purpose of the Cyclistic project, including its goals and key dependencies. 
The Stakeholder requirements document outlines key stakeholder needs for developing a BI dashboard. It focuses on understanding customer usage patterns and demand at bike stations to guide strategic decisions for expansion and improvement.
The Strategy document details the BI dashboard development plan, including data sources, user profiles, and dashboard features. It outlines access restrictions, data scope, and key metrics like heat maps and area charts to analyze bike usage, seasonal trends, and weather impacts. The document is in draft and has to be reviewed before implementation.</details>

#### 2 - ETL code and SQL documents
<details> <summary> Query details (click here) </summary>
I created the queries for this scenario using BigQuery and leveraged BigQuery’s public datasets to develop the analysis. This approach allowed me to utilize large datasets for comprehensive insights and effective scenario modeling. Also, i uploaded an additional file with the zip codes in NYC. 
The annual query was designed to retrieve annual relevant data; but i had a problem, the zip codes coordinates were not recognized by Tableau, so i had to include them in que query. However, including variables such as stations and coordinates resulted in an excessively large file size that was impractical for download. Therefore, the coordinates were included in a second query to manage the data more efficiently.
Finnaly, the summer query was performed without problems.

### Usage Insights for a Fictional Bike Share Company: The Cyclistic Bike-Share Project Data Analysis


<details> <summary>Scenario (click here)</summary>  
In this project, I analyzed how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently to develop strategies for increasing annual memberships. The analysis aimed to uncover patterns in bike usage, understand key differences between membership types, and provide actionable insights for a targeted marketing strategy. I used R for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau to create visualizations in a dashboard to support the findings. I created a report using R Markdown. Additionally, a different version of the report, performed with Python, is also included in the project.
